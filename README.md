- 👋 Hi, I’m @GratefulWes
- 👀 I’m interested in Making Smiles and Spreading Love while doing all I can to earn the trust needed to convince the world that we can overcome the darknes if each of us locate our love light from within and let it shine bright while we remind ourselves that if we can light up even the darkest of places with the weakest flame then with the if we were to all join together selflessly then perhaps we can one day overcome the darkness that exists to feed off our fears and selfishly cause us to lose our way
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... none of us carries the ability to do it all alone making the importance of coming together despite our differences undeniable and only then, we can join our strengths to harness the light needed to prevail. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... ways to live a sustainable life by means of passive income and designing a plan that will ensure all who heed the calling have the opportunity so that regardless of the lack of employment opportunities in the future,  every light carrier will have access to the monetary tools required to survive comfortably.
